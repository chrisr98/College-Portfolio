After I do a search, if I am logged into my account my results are automatically stored in my search history with the activities I selected, the country and city/cities suggested, and links to the plane and hotel fares. If I am not a logged-in user I have to click on “Log in to save trips” which brings me to the login page. This brings me back through the login/create an account steps in the first primary story. Once I’m done logging in (whether it’s after creating a new account or not). I’m brought back to the page with my search results. If I click on my profile icon at the top it brings me to a page with my profile info set up in sections. Under “Search History” I see my past results starting from the most recent one and it includes the name of the country/city, and plane and hotel fares from the current time.
