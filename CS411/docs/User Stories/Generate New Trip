As a logged-in user, I want to generate a new trip. I select the “new trip” option, which takes me to another page. On the page, I select my activity preferences from drop-down menus and then click “Search”. This brings me to a new page that says “Take a trip to ___”, including the country I should go to. Below are three sections that include plane fares, hotel fares, and the current weather in that country.
