Create an account: As a user I want to create an account. I click on the button that says “Log In” which brings me to another page. On the bottom it has the option to “Create a new account” if I don’t already have one. When I click on that it brings me to another page that allows me to log in through my Facebook account or input my name, email, and password twice. After I create an account I get an email saying I successfully created an account. As a user I want to log in to my account. I click on the button that says “Log In” which brings me to another page. Depending on how I created my account I either click on “Log in with Facebook” or I type in my email and password. After I’m done logging in it brings me back to the page I was just on.
